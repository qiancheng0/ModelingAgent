In particular, the Forest Service is concerned about wildfires in a wilderness area consisting of small trees and brush in a park shaped like a square with dimensions 80 km on a side. Several years ago, the Forest Service constructed a network of north-south and east-west firebreaks that form a rectangular grid across the interior of the entire wilderness area. The firebreaks were built at 5 km intervals. Wildfires are most likely to occur during the dry season, which extends from July through September in this particular region. During this season, there is a prevailing westerly wind throughout the day. There are frequent lightning bursts that cause wildfires. The Forest Service wants to deploy four fire-fighting units to control fires during the next dry season. Each unit consists of 10 firefighters, one pickup truck, one dump truck, one water truck (50,000 liters), and one bulldozer (w/ truck and trailer). The unit has chainsaws, hand tools, and other fire-fighting equipment. The people can be quickly moved by helicopter within the wilderness area, but all the equipment must be driven via the existing firebreaks. One helicopter is on standby at all times throughout the dry season. Your task is to determine the best distribution of fire-fighting units within the wilderness area. The Forest Service is able to set up base camps for those units at sites anywhere within the area. In addition, you are asked to prepare a damage assessment forecast. This forecast will be used to estimate the amount of wilderness likely to be burned by fire as well as acting as a mechanism for helping the Service determine when additional fire-fighting units need to be brought in from elsewhere.",

The two basic types of wheels are those constructed using wire spokes and those constructed of a solid disk (see Figure 1). The spoked wheels are lighter, but the solid wheels are more aerodynamic. A solid wheel is never used on the front for a road race but can be used on the rear of the bike.\n\nProfessional cyclists look at a racecourse and make an educated guess as to what kind of wheels should be used. The decision is based on the number and steepness of the hills, the weather, wind speed, the competition, and other considerations. The director sportif of your favorite team would like to have a better system in place and has asked your team for information to help determine what kind of wheel should be used for a given course.\n\n<img>image001.png</img>\n\nFigure 1: A solid wheel is shown on the left and a spoked wheel is shown on the right.\n\nThe director sportif needs specific information to help make a decision and has asked your team to accomplish the tasks listed below. For each of the tasks assume that the same spoked wheel will always be used on the front but there is a choice of wheels for the rear.\n\nTask 1. Provide a table giving the wind speed at which the power required for a solid rear wheel is less than for a spoked rear wheel. The table should include the wind speeds for different road grades starting from zero percent to ten percent in one percent increments. (Road grade is defined to be the ratio of the total rise of a hill divided by the length of the road. If the hill is viewed as a triangle, the grade is the sine of the angle at the bottom of the hill.) A rider starts at the bottom of the hill at a speed of 45 kph, and the deceleration of the rider is proportional to the road grade. A rider will lose about 8 kph for a five percent grade over 100 meters.\n\nTask 2. Provide an example of how the table could be used for a specific time trial course.\n\nTask 3. Determine if the table is an adequate means for deciding on the wheel configuration and offer other suggestions as to how to make this decision.\n\n### Image File: image001.png\n\nThe image contains two circular diagrams side by side.\n\n1. **Left Circle:**\n   - The circle is filled with a gradient of gray shades, transitioning smoothly from light gray on the left side to dark gray on the right side.\n   - There is a small, solid gray dot located at the center of the circle.\n\n2. **Right Circle:**\n   - This circle resembles a bicycle wheel with spokes.\n   - It has a central black dot, representing the hub.\n   - Multiple straight black lines (spokes) radiate outward from the central dot to the circumference of the circle.\n   - The circle's outline is a solid black line.\n\nThere is no text present in the image.",

After you check in at the ticket counter, the airline clerk announces that your flight has been overbooked. Passengers need to check in immediately to determine if they still have a seat.\n\nHistorically, airlines know that only a certain percentage of passengers who have made reservations on a particular flight will actually take that flight. Consequently, most airlines overbook\u2014that is, they take more reservations than the capacity of the aircraft. Occasionally, more passengers will want to take a flight than the capacity of the plane, leading to one or more passengers being bumped and thus unable to take the flight for which they had reservations.\n\nAirlines deal with bumped passengers in various ways. Some are given nothing, some are booked on later flights on other airlines, and some are given some kind of cash or airline ticket incentive.\n\nConsider the overbooking issue in light of the current situation: Less flights by airlines from point A to point B, heightened security at and around airports, passengers' fear, and loss of billions of dollars in revenue by airlines to date.\n\nBuild a mathematical model that examines the effects that different overbooking schemes have on the revenue received by an airline company in order to find an optimal overbooking strategy, i.e., the number of people by which an airline should overbook a particular flight so that the company's revenue is maximized.

        "question": "Stereotactic radiosurgery delivers a single high dose of ionizing radiation to a radiographically well-defined, small intracranial 3D brain tumor without delivering any significant fraction of the prescribed dose to the surrounding brain tissue. Three modalities are commonly used in this area; they are the gamma knife unit, heavy charged particle beams, and external high-energy photon beams from linear accelerators. The gamma knife unit delivers a single high dose of ionizing radiation emanating from 201 cobalt-60 unit sources through a heavy helmet. All 201 beams simultaneously intersect at the isocenter, resulting in a spherical (approximately) dose distribution at the effective dose levels. Irradiating the isocenter to deliver dose is termed a \u201cshot.\u201d Shots can be represented as different spheres. Four interchangeable outer collimator helmets with beam channel diameters of 4, 8, 14, and 18 mm are available for irradiating different size volumes. For a target volume larger than one shot, multiple shots can be used to cover the entire target. In practice, most target volumes are treated with 1 to 15 shots. The target volume is a bounded, three-dimensional digital image that usually consists of millions of points. The goal of radiosurgery is to deplete tumor cells while preserving normal structures. Since there are physical limitations and biological uncertainties involved in this therapy process, a treatment plan needs to account for all those limitations and uncertainties. In general, an optimal treatment plan is designed to meet the following requirements.\n\nMinimize the dose gradient across the target volume. Match specified isodose contours to the target volumes. Match specified dose-volume constraints of the target and critical organ. Minimize the integral dose to the entire volume of normal tissues or organs. Constrain dose to specified normal tissue points below tolerance doses. Minimize the maximum dose to critical volumes.\n\nProhibit shots from protruding outside the target. Prohibit shots from overlapping (to avoid hot spots). Cover the target volume with effective dosage as much as possible. But at least 90% of the target volume must be covered by shots. Use as few shots as possible.",

        "question": "There are a wide variety of techniques available for irrigating a field. The technologies range from advanced drip systems to periodic flooding. One of the systems that is used on smaller ranches is the use of \"hand move\" irrigation systems. Lightweight aluminum pipes with sprinkler heads are put in place across fields, and they are moved by hand at periodic intervals to ensure that the whole field receives an adequate amount of water. This type of irrigation system is cheaper and easier to maintain than other systems. It is also flexible, allowing for use on a wide variety of fields and crops. The disadvantage is that it requires a great deal of time and effort to move and set up the equipment at regular intervals. Given that this type of irrigation system is to be used, how can it be configured to minimize the amount of time required to irrigate a field that is 80 meters by 30 meters? For this task, you are asked to find an algorithm to determine how to irrigate the rectangular field that minimizes the amount of time required by a rancher to maintain the irrigation system. One pipe set is used in the field. You should determine the number of sprinklers and the spacing between sprinklers, and you should find a schedule to move the pipes, including where to move them. A pipe set consists of a number of pipes that can be connected together in a straight line. Each pipe has a 10 cm inner diameter with rotating spray nozzles that have a 0.6 cm inner diameter. When put together, the resulting pipe is 20 meters long. At the water source, the pressure is 420 Kilo-Pascals and has a flow rate of 150 liters per minute. No part of the field should receive more than 0.75 cm per hour of water, and each part of the field should receive at least 2 centimeters of water every 4 days.

        "question": "One of the frustrations with air travel is the need to fly through multiple airports, and each stop generally requires each traveler to change to a different airplane. This can be especially difficult for people who are not able to easily walk to a different flight's waiting area. One of the ways that an airline can make the transition easier is to provide a wheelchair and an escort to those people who ask for help. It is generally known well in advance which passengers require help, but it is not uncommon to receive notice when a passenger first registers at the airport. In rare instances, an airline may not receive notice from a passenger until just prior to landing. Airlines are under constant pressure to keep their costs down. Wheelchairs wear out and are expensive and require maintenance. There is also a cost for making the escorts available. Moreover, wheelchairs and their escorts must be constantly moved around the airport so that they are available to people when their flight lands. In some large airports, the time required to move across the airport is nontrivial. The wheelchairs must be stored somewhere, but space is expensive and severely limited in an airport terminal. Also, wheelchairs left in high traffic areas represent a liability risk as people try to move around them. Finally, one of the biggest costs is the cost of holding a plane if someone must wait for an escort and becomes late for their flight. The latter cost is especially troubling because it can affect the airline's average flight delay, which can lead to fewer ticket sales as potential customers may choose to avoid an airline. Epsilon Airlines has decided to ask a third party to help them obtain a detailed analysis of the issues and costs of keeping and maintaining wheelchairs and escorts available for passengers. The airline needs to find a way to schedule the movement of wheelchairs throughout each day in a cost-effective way. They also need to find and define the costs for budget planning in both the short and long term. Epsilon Airlines has asked your consultant group to put together a bid to help them solve their problem. Your bid should include an overview and analysis of the situation to help them decide if you fully understand their problem. They require a detailed description of an algorithm that you would like to implement which can determine where the escorts and wheelchairs should be and how they should move throughout each day. The goal is to keep the total costs as low as possible. Your bid is one of many that the airline will consider. You must make a strong case as to why your solution is the best and show that it will be able to handle a wide range of airports under a variety of circumstances.

While this provides a way of determining how many representatives each state will have, it says nothing about how the district represented by a particular representative shall be determined geographically. This oversight has led to egregious (at least some people think so, usually not the incumbent) district shapes that look \"unnatural\" by some standards.

How would you do so as a purely \"baseline\" exercise to create the \"simplest\" shapes for all the districts in a state? The rules include only that each district in the state must contain the same population. The definition of \"simple\" is up to you; but you need to make a convincing argument to voters in the state that your solution is fair.

        "question": "Airlines are free to seat passengers waiting to board an aircraft in any order whatsoever. It has become customary to seat passengers with special needs first, followed by first-class passengers (who sit at the front of the plane). Then coach and business-class passengers are seated by groups of rows, beginning with the row at the back of the plane and proceeding forward. Apart from consideration of the passengers' wait time, from the airline's point of view, time is money, and boarding time is best minimized. The plane makes money for the airline only when it is in motion, and long boarding times limit the number of trips that a plane can make in a day. The development of larger planes, such as the Airbus A380 (800 passengers), accentuate the problem of minimizing boarding (and deboarding) time. Devise and compare procedures for boarding and deboarding planes with varying numbers of passengers: small (85-210), midsize (210-330), and large (450-800). Prepare an executive summary, not to exceed two single-spaced pages, in which you set out your conclusions to an audience of airline executives, gate agents, and flight crews. Note: The 2 page executive summary is to be included IN ADDITION to the reports required by the contest guidelines. An article appeared in the NY Times Nov 14, 2006 addressing procedures currently being followed and the importance to the airline of finding better solutions.",

Some of these traffic circles position a stop sign or a yield sign on every incoming road that gives priority to traffic already in the circle; some position a yield sign in the circle at each incoming road to give priority to incoming traffic; and some position a traffic light on each incoming road (with no right turn allowed on a red light). Other designs may also be possible.\n\nThe goal of this problem is to use a model to determine how best to control traffic flow in, around, and out of a circle. State clearly the objective(s) you use in your model for making the optimal choice as well as the factors that affect this choice. Include a Technical Summary of not more than two double-spaced pages that explains to a Traffic Engineer how to use your model to help choose the appropriate flow-control method for any specific traffic circle. That is, summarize the conditions under which each type of traffic-control method should be used. When traffic lights are recommended, explain a method for determining how many seconds each light should remain green (which may vary according to the time of day and other factors). Illustrate how your model works with specific examples.",

        "question": "Explain the \"sweet spot\" on a baseball bat. Every hitter knows that there is a spot on the fat part of a baseball bat where maximum power is transferred to the ball when hit. Why isn\u2019t this spot at the end of the bat? A simple explanation based on torque might seem to identify the end of the bat as the sweet spot, but this is known to be empirically incorrect. Develop a model that helps explain this empirical finding. Some players believe that \"corking\" a bat (hollowing out a cylinder in the head of the bat and filling it with cork or rubber, then replacing a wood cap) enhances the \"sweet spot\" effect. Augment your model to confirm or deny this effect. Does this explain why Major League Baseball prohibits \"corking\"? Does the material out of which the bat is constructed matter? That is, does this model predict different behavior for wood (usually ash) or metal (usually aluminum) bats? Is this why Major League Baseball prohibits metal bats?",

        "question": "The VHF radio spectrum involves line-of-sight transmission and reception. This limitation can be overcome by \"repeaters,\" which pick up weak signals, amplify them, and retransmit them on a different frequency. Thus, using a repeater, low-power users (such as mobile stations) can communicate with one another in situations where direct user-to-user contact would not be possible. However, repeaters can interfere with one another unless they are far enough apart or transmit on sufficiently separated frequencies. In addition to geographical separation, the \"continuous tone-coded squelch system\" (CTCSS), sometimes nicknamed \"private line\" (PL), technology can be used to mitigate interference problems. This system associates to each repeater a separate subaudible tone that is transmitted by all users who wish to communicate through that repeater. The repeater responds only to received signals with its specific PL tone. With this system, two nearby repeaters can share the same frequency pair (for receive and transmit); so more repeaters (and hence more users) can be accommodated in a particular area. For a circular flat area of radius 40 miles radius, determine the minimum number of repeaters necessary to accommodate 1,000 simultaneous users. Assume that the spectrum available is 145 to 148 MHz, the transmitter frequency in a repeater is either 600 kHz above or 600 kHz below the receiver frequency, and there are 54 different PL tones available. How does your solution change if there are 10,000 users? Discuss the case where there might be defects in line-of-sight propagation caused by mountainous areas.",

        "question": "Visitors to the Big Long River (225 miles) can enjoy scenic views and exciting white water rapids. The river is inaccessible to hikers, so the only way to enjoy it is to take a river trip that requires several days of camping. River trips all start at First Launch and exit the river at Final Exit, 225 miles downstream. Passengers take either oar-powered rubber rafts, which travel on average 4 mph, or motorized boats, which travel on average 8 mph. The trips range from 6 to 18 nights of camping on the river, start to finish. The government agency responsible for managing this river wants every trip to enjoy a wilderness experience, with minimal contact with other groups of boats on the river. Currently, X trips travel down the Big Long River each year during a six-month period (the rest of the year it is too cold for river trips). There are Y campsites on the Big Long River, distributed fairly uniformly throughout the river corridor. Given the rise in popularity of river rafting, the park managers have been asked to allow more trips to travel down the river. They want to determine how they might schedule an optimal mix of trips, of varying duration (measured in nights on the river) and propulsion (motor or oar) that will utilize the campsites in the best way possible. In other words, how many more boat trips could be added to the Big Long River\u2019s rafting season? The river managers have hired you to advise them on ways in which to develop the best schedule and on ways in which to determine the carrying capacity of the river, remembering that no two sets of campers can occupy the same site at the same time. In addition to your one-page summary sheet, prepare a one-page memo to the managers of the river describing your key findings.",

        "question": "In 2014, the world saw the infectious Ebola virus spreading in western Africa. Throughout human history, epidemics have come and gone with some infecting and/or killing thousands and lasting for years and others taking less of a human toll. Some believe these events are just nature\u2019s way of controlling the growth of a species while others think they could be a conspiracy or deliberate act to cause harm. This problem will most likely come down to how to expend (or not expend) scarce resources (doctors, containment facilities, money, research, serums, etc...) to deal with a crisis.\n\nSituation: A routine humanitarian mission on an island in Indonesia reported a small village where almost half of its 300 inhabitants are showing similar symptoms. In the past week, 15 of the \"infected\" have died. This village is known to trade with nearby villages and other islands. Your modeling team works for a major center of disease control in the capital of your country (or if you prefer, for the International World Health Organization).\n\nRequirement 1: Develop a mathematical model(s) that performs the following functions as well as how/when to best allocate these scarce resources and... Determines and classifies the type and severity of the spread of the disease Determines if an epidemic is contained or not Triggers appropriate measures (when to treat, when to transport victims, when to restrict movement, when to let a disease run its course, etc...) to contain a disease Note: While you may want to start with the well-known \"SIR\" family of models for parts of this problem, consider others, modifications to the SIR, multiple models, or creating your own.\n\nRequirement 2: Based on the information given, your model, and the assumptions your team has made, what initial recommendations does your team have for your country\u2019s center for disease control? (Give 3-5 recommendations with justifications) Additional Situational Information: A multi-national research team just returned to your country\u2019s capital after spending 7 days gathering information in the infected village. Requirement 3: You can ask them up to 3 questions to improve your model. What would you ask and why? Additional Situational Information: The multi-national research team concluded that the disease: Appears to spread through contact with bodily fluids of an infected person The elderly and children are more likely to die if infected A nearby island is starting to show similar signs of infection One of the researchers that returned to your capital appears infected Requirement 4: How does the additional information above change/modify your model? Requirement 5: Write a one-page synopsis of your findings for your local non-technical news outlet.",

Water scarcity arises from physical scarcity (inadequate water supply) and economic scarcity (poor management and infrastructure). Climate change and population growth may worsen this issue. The challenge is to determine if increasing personal or industrial consumption, or pollution, is contributing to scarcity.\n\n**Key Questions:**\n- Can clean water be provided to all?\n- How do environmental and social factors affect water availability?\n- What historical actions have impacted water scarcity?\n- What are the geological and ecological reasons for scarcity?\n- What potential exists for new water sources?\n- What demographic and health issues are linked to water scarcity?\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nThe International Clean Water Movement (ICM) seeks solutions to global water problems. Your task is to improve access to clean, fresh water.\n\n**Tasks:**\n\n1. **Model Development:**\n   - Create a model to measure a region's ability to provide clean water, considering dynamic supply and demand factors.\n\n2. **Region Analysis:**\n   - Select a country or region from the UN water scarcity map where water is heavily or moderately overloaded.\n   - Explain the causes of water scarcity, addressing both social and environmental factors.\n\n3. **Future Projection:**\n   - Use your model to predict the water situation in the chosen region in 15 years.\n   - Assess the impact on citizens' lives, incorporating environmental drivers.\n\n4. **Intervention Plan:**\n   - Design a plan addressing all drivers of water scarcity.\n   - Discuss the plan's impact on the region and surrounding areas, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.\n\n5. **Future Water Availability:**\n   - Project future water availability using your intervention plan and model.\n   - Determine if the region can become less susceptible to scarcity and predict when scarcity might become critical.\n\n6. **Report Writing:**\n   - Write a 20-page report detailing your model, the region's water scarcity without intervention, your intervention plan, and its effects.\n   - Include strengths and weaknesses of your model.\n\n**Resources:**\n- An Overview of the State of the World\u2019s Fresh and Marine Waters (2008)\n- The World\u2019s Water: Information on the World\u2019s Freshwater Resources\n- AQUASTAT by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n- The State of the World's Land and Water Resources for food and agriculture (2011)\n- GrowingBlue: Water.

        "question": "<link>2016_IMMC_Problem.pdf</link> <link>2016_IMMC_Problem.pdf</link> Record Insurance\n\n### Text in the PDF File: 2016_IMMC_Problem.pdf\n\n**2016 IM2C Problem: Record Insurance**\n\n**Context:**\nIn athletics, a 15,000-meter (15k) run is a common event, with world records set for such distances. Organizing committees often offer significant bonuses for setting new world records to attract top runners. For instance, a 15k race in the Netherlands offered a 25,000 euro bonus for breaking the world record. However, the committee faced financial risks as they did not purchase insurance.\n\n**Problem Overview:**\n1. **Average Cost of Bonus:**\n   - Calculate the average cost of the bonus for a 15k run with a 25,000 euro bonus. This is defined as the bonus amount divided by the expected number of races before the record is broken. For example, if the record is expected to be broken every 25 races, the average cost is 1,000 euros per race.\n\n2. **Insurance Company Criteria:**\n   - Determine the criteria for an insurance company to decide the additional amount to add to the average cost. Consider factors like operating costs, time value of money, and profit margins. For instance, an insurer might add 20% to cover these aspects.\n\n3. **Organizing Committee Decision:**\n   - (a) Criteria for deciding whether to purchase insurance, considering long-term sponsorship plans and potential savings from self-insuring.\n   - (b) Evaluate the risk of not purchasing insurance.\n\n4. **Multiple Event Insurance Decision:**\n   - For a major track meet with 40 events (20 men's and 20 women's), decide which events to insure. Consider factors like the likelihood of records being broken and financial implications.\n\n5. **General Decision Scheme:**\n   - Develop a decision-making framework for organizing committees to determine whether to purchase insurance or self-insure for each event. This should be clear and implementable.\n\n**Zevenheuvelenloop Race Overview:**\n- The Zevenheuvelenloop is an annual 15k road race in Nijmegen, Netherlands, first organized in 1984. It is one of the largest road races in the country, attracting over 30,000 runners in 2008. The race is known for its fast course, with world records set by Felix Limo in 2001 and Tirunesh Dibaba in 2009. Leonard Komon improved the men's world record in 2010.\n\n**Race Statistics:**\n- Notable winners include Haile Gebrselassie and Tegla Loroupe, each with multiple victories.\n- The race has been a test event for the ChampionChip timing system.\n\n**Winners by Country:**\n- Ethiopia: 10 men's and 10 women's wins\n- Netherlands: 7 men's and 6 women's wins\n- Kenya: 7 men's and 6 women's wins\n\nThis problem requires a strategic approach to managing financial risks associated with athletic events, particularly in offering bonuses for world records. The solution should consider both the financial implications and the attractiveness of the event to top athletes.",

        "question": "Organizing international meetings is not easy in many ways, including the problem that some of the participants may experience the effects of jet lag after recent travel from their home country to the meeting location which may be in a different time-zone, or in a different climate and time of year, and so on. All these things may dramatically affect the productivity of the meeting.\n\nThe International Meeting Management Corporation (IMMC) has asked your expert group (your team) to help solve the problem by creating an algorithm that suggests the best place(s) to hold a meeting given the number of participants, their home cities, approximate dates of the meeting and other information that the meeting management company may request from its clients.\n\nThe participants are usually from all corners of the Earth, and the business or scientific meeting implies doing hard intellectual team work for three intensive days, with the participants contributing approximately equally to the end result. Assume that there are no visa problems or political limitations, and so any country or city can be a potential meeting location.\n\nThe output of the algorithm should be a list of recommended places (regions, zones, or specific cities) that maximize the overall productivity of the meeting. The questions of costs are not of primary importance, but the IMMC, just as any other company, has a limited budget. So the costs may be considered as a secondary criterion. And the IMMC definitely cannot afford bringing the participants in a week before the meeting to acclimatize or give them the time to rest after a long exhausting journey.\n\nTest your algorithm at least on the two following datasets:\n\nScenario 1) \u201cSmall Meeting\u201d:\n\nTime: mid-June Participants: 6 individuals from: Monterey CA, USA Zutphen, Netherlands Melbourne, Australia Shanghai, China Hong Kong (SAR), China Moscow, Russia\n\nScenario 2) \u201cBig meeting\u201d:\n\nTime: January Participants: 11 individuals from: Boston MA, USA (2 people) Singapore Beijing, China Hong Kong (SAR), China (2 people) Moscow, Russia Utrecht, Netherlands Warsaw, Poland Copenhagen, Denmark Melbourne, Australia",

Smart growth aims to make cities economically prosperous, socially equitable, and environmentally sustainable. With rapid urbanization, it's projected that by 2050, 66% of the global population will live in urban areas, adding 2.5 billion people to urban populations. Urban planning is crucial to provide equitable and sustainable living conditions.\n\nSmart growth, originating in the 1990s, addresses urban sprawl and farmland loss. Its ten principles are:\n1. Mix land uses\n2. Utilize compact building design\n3. Offer diverse housing options\n4. Create walkable neighborhoods\n5. Foster distinctive communities with a strong sense of place\n6. Preserve open spaces and critical environmental areas\n7. Direct development towards existing communities\n8. Provide diverse transportation options\n9. Ensure predictable, fair, and cost-effective development decisions\n10. Encourage community and stakeholder collaboration\n\nThese principles must be adapted to each community's unique needs, considering demographics, growth needs, and geographical conditions.\n\n**Tasks:**\nThe International City Management Group (ICM) seeks assistance in applying smart growth theories to city design globally. Select two mid-sized cities (population 100,000-500,000) on different continents.\n\n1. Define a metric to measure smart growth success, considering the three E\u2019s of sustainability and/or the 10 smart growth principles.\n2. Research and evaluate the current growth plans of the selected cities against smart growth principles using your metric.\n3. Develop a smart growth plan for both cities for the coming decades, justifying your choices based on geography, growth rates, and economic opportunities. Evaluate the success of your plans using your metric.\n4. Rank the initiatives within your smart growth plan from most to least potential using your metric. Compare and contrast the initiatives and their rankings between the two cities.\n5. Explain how your plan supports a 50% population increase by 2050.\n\n**References:**\n1.

        "question": "A number of communities (campuses, towns, cities, etc.) around the world have proposed and enacted plastic water bottle bans in some form. \n\n<link>2019_HiMCM_Problem_B_FAQ.pdf</link> <link>2019_HiMCM_Problem_B_FAQ.pdf</link>\n\nIn 2013, the small town of Concord, Massachusetts (population approximately 19,000) became the first town or city in the United States to ban the sale of single-serving Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles less than or equal to 1 liter (34 ounces) containing water which is non-sparkling and non-flavored (in other words, plain water)[1]. The sale of water in bottles of any size made of other types of plastic or other materials, as well as PET bottles of flavored or sparkling water, soda, tea, juices, and other non-plain water beverages, regardless of size, is allowed[2]. See attached FAQ document. Concord citizens supporting this action stated various reasons including: concerns of plastic garbage and litter, use of fossil fuels in the production of plastic, product transportation emissions, damage to water-providing aquifers, and beliefs that businesses shouldn\u2019t profit on the sale of a free resource. Since enactment of Concord's ban, a handful of other communities in the United States have enacted single-serving water bottle bans, the largest being the city of San Francisco (population approximately 885,000) who banned the sale of single-serving water bottles on city property in 2014[3]. Just recently, the San Francisco Airport decided to comply with its city\u2019s law and banned the sale of single-serving water bottles, making it the first airport to do so[4]. Not everyone is in favor of these bans, nor does everyone think that these bans will have any impact on the issues they are trying to address. Opponents include the International Bottled Water Association (IBWA) who, after the San Francisco ban, stated that there are unintended consequences to these bans as they may lead to \"more packaging, more additives (e.g., sugar, caffeine), and greater environmental impacts than bottled water[5].\" Additionally, as we have seen in recent world news, in some areas (e.g. unavailability/inaccessibility of fresh water) and under some circumstances (e.g. natural disasters, compromises in water delivery) bottled water is a necessary and critical resource.\n\n1. Model the impacts of a ban on the sale of single-serving water bottles in a town or city. Use your model to discuss the impacts of the bans in the Town of Concord and the City of San Francisco.\n\n   a. Identify the possible impacts (positive and negative) of a ban on the sale of single-serving water bottles within a town or city.\n\n   b. What information and data do you need to model and measure these impacts? How would you collect this information and these data? (Note: You do not need to actually collect information and data, but need to identify what you need and how you might obtain it.)\n\n   c. Develop a model or set of models to measure water bottle ban impacts.\n\n   d. Discuss the application of your model to Concord and San Francisco.\n\n2. Address the impacts of a ban on the sale of single-serving water bottles within an airport. How are the impacts similar to and different from a ban in a town or city? How would your initial model for a town or city change, if at all, to model bottle ban impacts within an airport?\n\n3. Discuss and recommend possible changes to Concord\u2019s water bottle ban, or other related community measures, that would enhance beneficial impacts and reduce adverse impacts. Use your suggested changes to adjust your impact model. Address whether or not your new model is generalizable to larger communities (e.g. large cities, regions, states, countries).\n\n4. Write a one-page article for your local newspaper reporting your findings and recommendations.\n\n<link>2019_HiMCM_Problem_B_FAQ.pdf</link> <link>2019_HiMCM_Problem_B_FAQ.pdf</link>\n\nNote: Reference List and any appendices do not count toward the page limit and should appear after your completed solution.\n\nAttachment: Town of Concord, Massachusetts.

These bottles have the number 1 and/or PETE with the recycling symbol.\n\n**Prohibited Bottles:**\n- The bylaw prohibits the sale of non-sparkling, unflavored drinking water in PET bottles of 1 liter (34 ounces) or less.\n- Bottles made from other plastics are allowed.\n- The sale of juice beverages, flavored waters, and sparkling water in any size is permitted.\n\n**Electrolyte or Mineral-Added Water:**\n- Unflavored, non-sparkling water with added electrolytes or minerals in bottles of 34 ounces or less cannot be sold.\n- Flavored versions of such water can be sold regardless of size.\n\n**Cases of Bottled Water:**\n- Selling cases of small bottles (1 liter or less) of non-sparkling, unflavored water is prohibited.\n\n**Vending Machines and Civic Events:**\n- Bottled water in PET bottles of 1 liter or less cannot be sold in vending machines or at civic events if it is plain, non-sparkling, and unflavored.\n\n**Free Water:**\n- Bottled or cup water can be offered for free.\n\n**Voluntary Donations:**\n- Businesses cannot solicit donations for bottled water, as it is considered a sale.\n\n**Enforcement:**\n- The Health Division is responsible for ensuring compliance. Inspections began in January 2013.\n- First-time violators receive a written warning. A $25 fine is issued upon a second violation, and a $50 fine for subsequent violations.\n\n**Appeal Process:**\n- To contest a Non-Criminal Citation, a written request for a hearing must be filed at District Court within 21 days of receiving the citation.",

        "question": "In our school and social lives we exist in a mobile electronic world. Each day we \"plug in\" and charge our electronic devices and equipment. These electronics may range from small items (cell phones) to large items (electric vehicles). While in our own home, our family is most likely responsible for purchasing the charging equipment, and then paying an electric company/provider for the electricity we use.\n\nPublic places are continually expanding the availability of electrical outlets, charging stations, and even electric vehicle charging parking spots. For example, many airports have recently refurbished their parking lots, terminals, and aircraft to allow for electrical charging of everything from portable devices to vehicles. In some locations, these charging ports require a fee, but many public places worldwide offer charging for \"free.\" But, what is the impact of \"plugging in\" our electronics at these \"free\" charging sites in public places such as airports, railway terminals, schools, libraries, shopping malls, coffee shops, and offices? And, who pays for it?\n\n1. Discuss how this type of energy consumption has changed over recent years and how it will continue to change. Identify impacts on, and requirements of, public places with these increasing energy (electricity) and charging demands.\n\n2. Use your identified impacts and requirements to develop a model for the resulting costs of the increased demands and energy usage on public places. Discuss the extent of these costs and how they are paid.\n\n3. Discuss how your model changes, if at all, for different types of public places (e.g. a school vs. a cafe/coffee shop vs. an airport vs. a shopping mall, etc.)?\n\n4. What initiatives should be explored to reduce the cost of this increased energy usage in public places? How would implementation of these initiatives adjust your cost model?\n\n5. Write a one-page article for your school newspaper describing your findings and recommendations.",

        "question": "Since the 1950s, the manufacturing of plastics has grown exponentially because of its variety of uses, such as food packaging, consumer products, medical devices, and construction. While there are significant benefits, the negative implications associated with increased production of plastics are concerning. Plastic products do not readily break down, are difficult to dispose of, and only about 9% of plastics are recycled[1]. Effects can be seen by the approximately 4-12 million tons of plastic waste that enter the oceans each year[1,2]. Plastic waste has severe environmental consequences and it is predicted that if our current trends continue, the oceans will be filled with more plastic than fish by 2050[2]. The effect on marine life has been studied[3], but the effects on human health are not yet completely understood[4]. The rise of single-use and disposable plastic products results in entire industries dedicated to creating plastic waste. It also suggests that the amount of time the product is useful is significantly shorter than the time it takes to properly mitigate the plastic waste. Consequently, to solve the plastic waste problem, we need to slow down the flow of plastic production and improve how we manage plastic waste.\n\nYour team has been hired by the International Council of Plastic Waste Management (ICM) to address this escalating environmental crisis. You must develop a plan to significantly reduce, if not eliminate, single-use and disposable plastic product waste.\n\nDevelop a model to estimate the maximum levels of single-use or disposable plastic product waste that can safely be mitigated without further environmental damage. You may need to consider, among many factors, the source of this waste, the extent of the current waste problem, and the availability of resources to process the waste.\n\nDiscuss to what extent plastic waste can be reduced to reach an environmentally safe level. This may involve considering factors impacting the levels of plastic waste to include, but not limited to, sources and uses of single-use or disposable plastics, the availability of alternatives to plastics, the impact on the lives of citizens, or policies of cities, regions, countries, and continents to decrease single-use or disposable plastic and the effectiveness of such policies. These can vary between regions, so considering regional-specific constraints may make some policies more effective than others.\n\nUsing your model and discussion, set a target for the minimal achievable level of global waste of single-use or disposable plastic products and discuss the impacts for achieving such levels. You may consider ways in which human life is altered, the environmental impacts, or the effects on the multi-trillion-dollar plastic industry.\n\nWhile this is a global problem, the causes and effects are not equally distributed across nations or regions. Discuss the equity issues that arise from the global crisis and your intended solutions. How do you suggest ICM address these issues?\n\nWrite a two-page memo to the ICM describing a realistic global target minimum achievable level of global single-use or disposable plastic product waste, a timeline to reach this level, and any circumstances that may accelerate or hinder the achievement of your target and timeline.\n\nYour submission should consist of:\n\nOne-page Summary Sheet, Two-page Memo. Your solution of no more than 20 pages.\n\nGlossary\n\nDisposable Plastic Products: plastic materials or products that are not recyclable and become trash. Mitigate: To make less severe, to moderate, to alleviate. Plastic Waste: plastic objects that have not been recycled properly or cannot be recycled; debris made of plastic.

        "question": "Global ocean temperatures affect the quality of habitats for certain ocean-dwelling species. When temperature changes are too great for their continued thriving, these species move to seek other habitats better suited to their present and future living and reproductive success. One example of this is seen in the lobster population of Maine, USA, that is slowly migrating north to Canada where the lower ocean temperatures provide a more suitable habitat. This geographic population shift can significantly disrupt the livelihood of companies who depend on the stability of ocean-dwelling species.\n\nYour team has been hired as consultants by a Scottish North Atlantic fishery management consortium. The consortium wants to gain a better understanding of issues related to the potential migration of Scottish herring and mackerel from their current habitats near Scotland if and when global ocean temperatures increase. These two fish species represent a significant economic contribution to the Scottish fishing industry. Changes in population locations of herring and mackerel could make it economically impractical for smaller Scotland-based fishing companies, who use fishing vessels without on-board refrigeration, to harvest and deliver fresh fish to markets in Scotland fishing ports.\n\nRequirements\n\n1. Build a mathematical model to identify the most likely locations for these two fish species over the next 50 years, assuming that water temperatures are going to change enough to cause the populations to move.\n\n2. Based upon how rapidly the ocean water temperature change occurs, use your model to predict best case, worst case, and most likely elapsed time(s) until these populations will be too far away for small fishing companies to harvest if the small fishing companies continue to operate out of their current locations.\n\n3. In light of your predictive analysis, should these small fishing companies make changes to their operations?\n\n   a. If yes, use your model to identify and assess practical and economically attractive strategies for small fishing companies. Your strategies should consider, but not be limited to, realistic options that include:\n   - Relocating some or all of a fishing company\u2019s assets from a current location in a Scottish port to closer to where both fish populations are moving;\n   - Using some proportion of small fishing vessels capable of operating without land-based support for a period of time while still ensuring the freshness and high quality of the catch.\n   - Other options that your team may identify and model.\n\n   b. If your team rejects the need for any changes, justify reasons for your rejection based on your modeling results as they relate to the assumptions your team has made.\n\n4. Use your model to address how your proposal is affected if some proportion of the fishery moves into the territorial waters (sea) of another country.\n\n5. In addition to your technical report, prepare a one- to two-page article for Hook Line and Sinker magazine to help fishermen understand the seriousness of the problem and how your proposed solution(s) will improve their future business prospects.\n\nYour submission should consist of:\n\n- One-page Summary Sheet\n- One- to Two-page Article\n- Your solution of no more than 20 pages, for a maximum of 24 pages with your summary and article.\n\nGlossary\n\nFishery: The collection of fish of a given species and the area that they inhabit.\n\nHabitat: The type of environment in which an organism or group normally lives or occurs.\n\nSmall Fishing Company: A company engaged in commercial fishing with limited or very limited financial resources to invest in new equipment/vessels.\n\nTerritorial Waters (sea): \"as defined by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, is a belt of coastal waters extending at most 12 nautical miles (22.2 km; 13.8 mi) from the baseline (usually the mean low-water mark) of a coastal state.

        "question": "Although it's only November, you need to start planning for your 2021 summer job. You have a variety of choices this year and want to determine your \"best\" choice. You pose this problem for your team of math friends: We have many opportunities for a summer job. Some allow us to work from home virtually/electronically, some are a walk or bike ride away, and others require us to drive or take a train. Each job offers differing numbers of hours each week and the hourly rates also vary. Some involve physical activity, or at least not sitting at a desk (e.g. cashier at a store, lifeguarding, or wait staff at a restaurant), while others are mostly sedentary and perhaps use analytical and organizational skills (e.g. data analysis, office administration, or research). Let's develop a model that will evaluate the choices we have for our summer jobs and help us all find the \"best\" job. While we certainly want to earn and save some money, we also want to have time for recreation activities (e.g. exercise, outings, and social time with friends). Let's make our model one that will be helpful for all high school students to think about and analyze their summer job options.\n\n1. What factors should high school students who are looking for a summer job consider? List and describe the various factors your team identifies. Note that factors may be quantitative or qualitative, constant or variable, and deterministic or probabilistic. Be sure to include units as appropriate.\n\n2. Use your factors to develop a model or algorithm (or set of models/algorithms) for a high school student to use to evaluate their summer job options based on their own situation and preferences as inputs to your model.\n\n3. Test your model with at least ten fictional persons that you create with reasonable data. Explain your development of these fictional persons and the data you chose. Analyze the results of the application of your model on these persons.\n\nYour PDF solution of no more than 25 total pages should include:\n\n- One-page Summary Sheet.\n- Your complete solution.\n\nGlossary:\n\n- Deterministic: processes that have only one (predetermined) outcome.\n- Fictional: not real or true; made up.\n- Probabilistic: processes based on the theory of probability or that randomness plays a role in predicting future events.\n- Sedentary: characterized by much sitting and little physical activity.",

Carbon sequestration, the process of capturing and storing carbon dioxide, is crucial. Forests play a vital role in this process by sequestering carbon in living plants and forest products like furniture and paper. Effective forest management, including appropriate harvesting, can enhance carbon sequestration. However, overharvesting can reduce these benefits. Forest managers must balance the value of forest products with the benefits of allowing forests to grow and sequester carbon.\n\n**Requirements**\n\nThe International Carbon Management (ICM) Collaboration aims to guide forest managers worldwide.

A rider's power curve shows the maximum power they can sustain over different durations. More power typically means less time before needing recovery. Riders must manage their power to minimize race time, considering fatigue and energy limits.\n\n**Objective**\nDevelop a model to determine the relationship between a cyclist's position on a course and the power they apply, considering energy limits and past exertion.\n\n**Model Requirements**\n1. Define power profiles for two rider types: a time trial specialist and another type (consider gender differences).\n2. Apply the model to:\n   - 2021 Olympic Time Trial course in Tokyo, Japan\n   - A custom-designed course with at least four sharp turns and a nontrivial road grade, ending near its start.\n3. Assess the impact of weather conditions, such as wind direction and strength.\n4. Evaluate sensitivity to deviations from target power distribution.\n5. Extend the model for a team time trial with six riders, focusing on the fourth rider's finish time.\n\n**Deliverables**\n- A two-page race guidance for a Directeur Sportif, focusing on one rider and one course, with an overview and model summary.\n- A complete solution of no more than 25 pages, including:\n  - One-page Summary Sheet\n  - Complete solution\n  - Two-page rider\u2019s race guidance\n\n**Glossary**\n- **Criterium**: A race on a closed course, defined by laps or time.\n- **Directeur Sportif**: Team director managing riders and race strategy.\n- **Individual Time Trial**: Riders race alone on a set course; fastest time wins.\n- **Power Curve**: Graph of maximum power a rider can sustain over time.\n\n**Rider Types**\n- **Climber**: Excels in long climbs.\n- **Puncheur**: Specializes in short, steep climbs and accelerations.\n- **Rouleur**: Versatile across various terrains.\n- **Sprinter**: High power for short bursts, focuses on race finishes.\n- **Time Trial Specialist**: Excels in individual time trials.",

However, climate change is reducing water volumes, impacting both water supply and electricity generation. In the U.S., states like Arizona, California, Wyoming, New Mexico, and Colorado are negotiating water and electricity management at the Glen Canyon and Hoover dams. Current agreements allocate more water than is available, and continued drought could lead to shortages.\n\n**Task**\n\nDevelop a water allocation plan for the five states, considering:\n\n- Coordination between Glen Canyon (Lake Powell) and Hoover (Lake Mead) dams.\n- Allocation of water and electricity to agriculture, industry, and residences.\n- Mexico's rights to residual water.\n- Potential water flow into the Gulf of California.\n\n**Model Requirements**\n\n1. Create a mathematical model to manage fixed water supply and demand conditions.\n2. Determine water draw from Lake Mead and Lake Powell to meet demands.\n3. Assess how long demands can be met without additional water supply.\n4. Recommend solutions for competing interests between water usage and electricity production.\n5. Address scenarios where water is insufficient to meet all demands.\n\n**Considerations**\n\n- Changes in water and electricity demands due to population and industrial growth or decline.\n- Increased use of renewable energy technologies.\n- Implementation of water and electricity conservation measures.\n\n**Submission Requirements**\n\n- A mathematical solution for water allocation, independent of historical agreements or political influences.\n- A one- to two-page article for \"Drought and Thirst\" magazine.\n- A complete solution within 25 pages, including a summary and main solution content.",

The task is to develop a model to understand the ecological impacts of these variations.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- **Adaptive Sex Ratio Variation:** Some species, like the American alligator, have sex ratios influenced by environmental factors (e.g., nest temperature). Sea lampreys' sex ratios are influenced by larval growth rates, which depend on food availability.\n\n- **Sea Lampreys:** These are jawless fish found in coastal and freshwater habitats. They are both parasites and a food source in various regions.\n\n- **Sex Ratio Influence:** \n  - Low food availability leads to slower growth rates, resulting in approximately 78% males.\n  - High food availability results in about 56% males.\n\n**Questions to Explore:**\n\n1. **Ecological Impact:** How does the ability of lampreys to alter their sex ratio affect the larger ecosystem?\n2. **Population Dynamics:** What are the advantages and disadvantages for lampreys in altering their sex ratio?\n3. **Ecosystem Stability:** How do changes in lamprey sex ratios impact ecosystem stability?\n4. **Ecosystem Benefits:** Can variable sex ratios in lampreys offer advantages to other ecosystem members, such as parasites?\n\n**Submission Requirements:**\n\n- A complete solution with a one-page summary.",

In 2022, insurance claims for natural disasters rose by 115% compared to the 30-year average. Climate change is expected to further increase these losses, with insurance premiums projected to rise by 30-60% by 2040. The insurance protection gap, the difference between economic losses and covered losses, averages 57% worldwide and is growing.\n\n**Challenges:**\n- Rising insurance costs and reduced availability as insurers adjust underwriting policies.\n- The dilemma of profitability for insurers versus affordability for property owners.\n- The need for a resilient insurance system to cover future claims while ensuring the long-term health of insurance companies.\n\n**Objectives:**\n1. Develop a model for insurance companies to determine underwriting policies in areas with increasing extreme weather events.\n2. Adapt the model to assess real-estate decisions, ensuring properties are resilient and services viable for growing communities.\n3. Create a preservation model for community leaders to protect culturally or historically significant buildings.\n\n**Tasks:**\n1. **Insurance Model Development:**\n   - Determine conditions under which insurance companies should underwrite policies.\n   - Identify actions property owners can take to influence underwriting decisions.\n   - Demonstrate the model using two areas on different continents experiencing extreme weather.\n\n2. **Real-Estate Assessment:**\n   - Adapt the insurance model to guide decisions on where and how to build resilient properties.\n\n3. **Preservation Model:**\n   - Develop a model to help community leaders decide on preserving significant buildings.\n   - Apply the model to a historic landmark (not Cape Hatteras Lighthouse) in an area prone to extreme weather.\n\n4. **Community Engagement:**\n   - Compose a one-page letter to a community recommending a plan, timeline, and cost proposal for preserving a landmark based on the models.\n\n**Submission Requirements:**\n- A solution of up to 25 pages, including a summary sheet, complete solution, and community letter\n\n**References:**\n1.
